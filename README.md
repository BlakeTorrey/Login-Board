# Kanban Board

## Description
Using the Kanban board, users can log-in and create tickets that have a variety of status possibilities. The tickets have a name, description, status, and a user creation tag for whoever created the ticket.

## Use
Currently, there is no user creation functionallity but the board has several seeded users that are available to use currently, they are: "JollyGuru", "SunnyScribe", and "RadiantComet". All three usernames simply use the password "password" and someone can log-in. 

User creation is anticipated to be possible within a few versions.
